# NLP_Name_Detector

This repository contains a Streamlit web application for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy. The application allows users to input text, visualize tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, and view named entity recognition results.

## NLP Aspects

This repository focuses on the following natural language processing (NLP) aspects:

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** The core feature of this application is to identify and highlight named entities in text data. It utilizes the spaCy library for accurate NER.

- **Tokenization:** The app demonstrates tokenization, the process of splitting text into individual words or tokens, which is a fundamental step in many NLP tasks.

- **Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS):** It also provides insights into the part-of-speech tagging of tokens, helping users understand the grammatical structure of the input text.

- **Customizable:** You can easily adapt and extend this application to handle various NLP tasks and experiment with different spaCy models and techniques.
